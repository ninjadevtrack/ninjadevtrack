<h2 align="center">ðŸ”¥ Senior Software Developer</h2>

My passion is technology, business and people. I love working with people and highly believe that the quality of a project's performance is deeply rooted in the passion, diligence, discipline and values of each individual involved in the project. The biggest value you can bring to a project is choosing individuals with an inherent passion for daily involvement in the project's progress. Please choose me if you are seeking a guy who is dedicated to the discipline of the project's inner workings. Then, I will become your project's driving force.

After graduating the university with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, Iâ€™ve been working on developing websites and applications focusing on start-ups, though working with bigger companies as well.
Taking dreams into reality is a passion and a calling. Energizing and fueling companies and individuals to help them reach their full potential is a joy. I've journeyed on many projects from start up to full success. I'm a passionate technologist and a lifelong learner eager to make each moment the best it can be.
